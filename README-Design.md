### Tools of the Trade

- You must be proficient with digital design and mock-up tools. 
- You must know how to use templates and prebuilt art to save time; a designer often works like a conductor, orchestrating premade work to make a coherent whole. 
- You must keep up with trends so your work feels fresh (even if freshness comes by going _against_ trends). 
- You must reach out to design blogs and magazines for sources of inspiration.
- You must seek guidance from seasoned peers and become part of a professional community. Start early by putting your work on portfolio sites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/). Solicit [C+R](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-critiques/) from members of these sites and other communities like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/web). Follow your favorite creatives on social media. Subscribe to [newsletters](https://learnui.design/newsletter.html).

## Projects

### 1. Project Generator

Using the design and mock-up program Figma, and the project generator linked below, complete a *Branding, Marketing, and UX / Product* design:

https://sharpen.design/

### 2. UX Project

Create a design for an interactive surf clock using Figma. 

The interactive design you complete should show time / date / weather and wave period / height information, as well as streamed video from a selectable list of surf spots. (The streaming video does not need to function; use a screenshot.) 

### 3. Marketing Project

Create a website to market an idea of your own for a business, product, or service. You may use templates, clip art sites (like Freepik / Unsplash / Canva), website generators (like Squarespace / Wix), or any other tools to help you go faster. Focus on information structure over design customization.

### 4. Self-promotion Project

Create a website to market yourself as a digital designer. Add links to your professional social media accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter) and social design profiles (Behance / Dribbble). Avoid personal and private content. You may use templates, website generators or any other tools you like to help. Add customizations to make it your own.
