#### Part 1. Web Client Software

You must understand HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 

README: Web browsers interpret three _frontend_ languages to display and manipulate client application data: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. _HTML_ describes the client's layout structure and meta-data (used by search engines). _CSS_ styles and animates HTML elements. _JavaScript_ creates complex interactivity by manipulating HTML & CSS and accessing special browser APIs. A web developer can do many cool things on the client with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. Strive to improve your proficiency in all three.

2) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML
3) https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
4) https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
5) https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

README: Technically, the client part of a web app can be written in HTML, _without CSS, or JavaScript_; however, doing so severely constrains the application's user experience. Try this out to help yourself only if you're having trouble grasping fundamentals.

README: Web developers usually master at least one web client _framework_, so should you. 

README: Frameworks, in general, are software tools developers use to reduce development time. Frameworks simplify code structures and separate concerns, making teamwork easier and improving source maintainability.  

README: Some popular _frontend (client)_ frameworks include [React](https://youtu.be/Dorf8i6lCuk) / [NextJS](https://youtu.be/1WmNXEVia8I), [Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) / [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) / [SvelteKit](https://youtu.be/UU7MgYIbtAk), and [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). The unique syntax of a web client framework, no matter how idiosyncratic, _always compiles_ to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

README: Some programs, including [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) (commercially implemented as Capacitor & Ionic) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org), allow developers to bundle web applications as native apps that can run outside of the browser. (They run the app in a hidden, mini-browser.) [VSCode]((https://www.electronjs.org/apps/visual-studio-code)) is a popular "web app" built using Electron.

README: Other languages are used to make client apps, including [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Dart/Flutter](https://flutter.dev), Swift, Objective C, Java, C, C++, C#, Godot Script, Lua, Unity / C#, and many others. These languages compile code to native binary or byte-code executables for running on a desktop or mobile device; [React-Native](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web), [GoDot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html), and [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html) can also compile code so it runs in a web browser.

#### Part 2. Web Server Software 

You must understand how to use at least one server-side language.

README: Developers use multiple _backend_ languages to handle server-side operations, including, but not limited to PHP, JavaScript (known as "NodeJS" on the backend), C#, Python, C++, Rust, Java, Erlang, Bash, and others:

1) https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/

README: Some web development frameworks handle the _full stack_, web client and server, with one primary language, e.g., [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/#!) (JS), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) (Python), and [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (PHP); these can optionally be used with "frontend only" helper frameworks, like the ones listed above, to make the client part of development easier.

README: Software developers, no matter what language they're using, take advantage of libraries of pre-built code to speed things up. Web developers use special libraries for JavaScript known as "packages". Packages can be downloaded from one of two popular package repositories, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (using the eponymous command line tools, `npm install` and `yarn install`). Note: Developers also add pre-built JavaScript libraries directly using special HTML links and JavaScript includes.

#### Part 3. Web Software Tests

You should know what software tests do. Many professional production environments require developers to write "unit tests" as a foundation of [Quality Assurance](https://youtu.be/gNmrGZSGK1k). Besides unit tests, there are also "integration" and "functional" tests.:

1) https://www.tutorialspoint.com/agile_testing/agile_testing_quadrants.htm

README: When __developing__ client / server software you will build and run both the client and server on your local machine. When __testing__, you will test your work on a remote development server. Prior to __release__, you and your colleagues will conduct user-acceptance, security, and stress testing with remote servers and clients.

#### Part 4. Requests and Responses

You must understand the request / response cycle in client-server applications. You must understand how to:
1) Send a request to a server from a client
2) Proxy (forward) requests using a webserver program like Apache or Nginx from the HTTP port to a process port or program executable
3) Action client requests from a server using a server script listening on a port
4) Action client requests from a server using a server script to communicate to a hosted or remote database 
4) Action client requests from a server using a server script to communicate to a 3rd party API, microservice, or Lambda compute service
6) Action client requests from a server using a server script and output from a native application executable or shell script
7) Store data uploaded from the client to the server on the server's file system, in a database, or via a 3rd party service (like AWS S3)
8) Generate a proper response, with data payload and appropriate headers, to the client
9) Use the term API to refer to a library, function, script, or remote app that accepts requests (inputs), and sends responses (outputs): https://free-apis.github.io/#/ 
10) Use a CDN: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/

### E. DNS

You show know about A Records, MX Records, and other DNS records. You should understand how the internet associates human readable names with machine readable IP addresses.

### F. DevOps

You should become proficient in DevOps.

README: DevOps in practice means utilizing two main skills to automate tasks: 
1) Writing scripts to set up virtual machines (VMs) with the operating systems, databases and programs you want pre installed and configured. 
2) Writing scripts to automate CICD (Continuous Integration / Deployment): This is automating the hosting of new versions of your app / game / tool via scripts that talk to your Github (or self-hosted) repo and your servers.

README: You find the scripts and programs you want for DevOps hosted online at different “hubs”, e.g.:

1) Ansible (set up programs on existing servers): https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?deprecated=false&keywords=penetration%20&order_by=-relevance&page=1
2) Vagrant (set up pre-configured servers / VMs): https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?utf8=✓&sort=downloads&provider=&q=kali
3) Docker (set up “containers“ - OSs and programs running inside their own little VMs): https://hub.docker.com/search?q=kali&type=image ; https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/

### F. DevSecOps

You should understand the purpose of automating security tools to test your software against exploits and hacks.

README: For development security ops, e.g., you will use DevOps tools to spin up and test an application’s full server structure (all the VMs and containers) on your home PC (a machine with 32-64GB ram would be ideal for this, min. 16GB ram).
