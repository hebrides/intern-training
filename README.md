### Part 1. Web Client Software

You must understand HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 

README: Web browsers interpret three _frontend_ [languages](https://flaviocopes.com/) to display and manipulate client application data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. _HTML_ describes the client's layout structure and meta-data (used by search engines). _CSS_ styles and animates HTML elements. _JavaScript_ creates complex interactivity by manipulating HTML & CSS and accessing special browser APIs. A web developer can do many cool things on the client with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. Strive to improve your proficiency in all three.

1) https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-learning-front-end-development-for-beginners-da6516505e41/
2) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML
3) https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
4) https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
5) https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp

README: Technically, the client part of a web app can be written in HTML, _without CSS, or JavaScript_; however, doing so severely constrains the application's user experience. Try this out to help yourself only if you're having trouble grasping fundamentals.

README: You need to understand the concept of code _frameworks_. [Frameworks](https://nicozerpa.com/why-are-there-so-many-javascript-frameworks/), in general, are software tools developers use to reduce development time. Frameworks simplify code structures and separate concerns, making teamwork easier and improving source maintainability.  

README: Professional web developers usually master at least one web client framework. You should make this your goal, too. 

README: Some popular _frontend (client)_ frameworks include [React](https://youtu.be/Dorf8i6lCuk) / [NextJS](https://youtu.be/1WmNXEVia8I), [Vue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) / [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) / [SvelteKit](https://youtu.be/UU7MgYIbtAk), [Remix](https://remix.run), and [Angular](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). The unique syntax of a web client framework, no matter how idiosyncratic, _always compiles_ to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHDQhDhvPE

README: [TypeScript](https://youtu.be/eCZhz0JCVx0) is a popular JavaScript-[_superset_](https://www.typescriptlang.org) designed to make it easier to [compose and debug JavaScript](https://youtu.be/Jp89ZbT2rQM). TypeScript compiles to regular JavaScript for running on the browser, your local PC, or a web server. TypeScript can be [auto-formatted](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2017/06/05/tslint-linting-setup/) ("linted"), like most programming languages.

README: [Sass](https://youtu.be/APM1mcKbK7o) is a CSS-compatible language designed to make it easier to write and maintain CSS styling code. Sass compiles to browser-readable CSS.

README: Some programs, including [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) (commercially implemented as Capacitor & Ionic) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org), allow developers to bundle web applications as native apps that can run outside of the browser. A hidden, mini-browser is deployed to contain the app. [VSCode]((https://www.electronjs.org/apps/visual-studio-code)) is a popular "web app" built using Electron. The advantage of  Cordova and Electron is they allow developers to deploy one code base to multiple platforms, reducing development and maintenance costs.

README: Other [languages](https://flaviocopes.com/) that are used to make client apps include [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev), [Dart/Flutter](https://flutter.dev), Swift, Objective C, Java, C, C++, C#, [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html), Lua, Unity / C#, [Rust](https://yew.rs/docs/en/intro/), and others. These languages compile code to native binary or byte-code executables for running on a desktop or mobile device; [React-Native](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web), [GoDot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html), and [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html) can also compile code so it runs in a web browser.

What is the advantage of using a web browser as a client?

### Part 2. Web Server Software 

You must understand how to use at least one server-side language.

README: Developers use multiple _backend_ languages to handle server-side operations (e.g., updating a database, performing an API service). These backend languages include, but are not limited to, PHP, JavaScript (known as "NodeJS" on the backend), [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet), [Python](https://www.djangoproject.com), [C](https://docs.kore.io/4.2.0/), [C++](https://oatpp.io), Rust, [Java](https://spring.io), Erlang, Bash, and [others](https://drogon.org): 

1) https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/

README: Some web development frameworks handle the _full stack_, web client and server, with one primary language, e.g., [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) (JS), [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps) (C#) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com) (PHP); these can optionally be used with different "frontend only" helper frameworks, like the ones listed above in Part 1 that focus on delivering HTML, CSS, & Javascript client pages.

README: Some frameworks work better than others in certain situations due to a number of factors, including _web application architecture_, business requirements, team size, developer skill-level, and team preferences:

1) https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/web-application-architecture
2) https://hackernoon.com/how-to-choose-a-web-application-framework
3) https://floverfelt.org/posts/software-best-practices.html

README: Software developers, no matter what language they're using, take advantage of [libraries](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3828/software-library) of pre-built code (often available as [FOSS](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/)) to speed things up. Web developers use [special libraries](https://12factor.net/dependencies) for JavaScript known as "packages". Packages can be downloaded from one of two popular package repositories, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (using the eponymous command line tools, `npm install` and `yarn install`). Note: Developers also add pre-built JavaScript libraries directly using special HTML links ([script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2872037/what-language-types-are-allowed-in-the-html-script-tag) tags) and JavaScript includes ([modules](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/950087/how-do-i-include-a-javascript-file-in-another-javascript-file#950146)). Note 2: Developers use [bundlers](https://youtu.be/5IG4UmULyoA), like Webpack / Parcel / Snowpack, to minify and combine web application code so it can be delivered to browsers more efficiently. 

NOTE: No developer can master _every_ language, framework, library or tool. Familiarize yourself with what you need to reach _your goals_. Start simple, move to complex.

### Part 3. Web Software Tests

You should know what software tests do. Many professional production environments require developers to write "unit tests" as a foundation of [Quality Assurance](https://youtu.be/gNmrGZSGK1k). Besides unit tests, there are also "integration" and "functional" tests.:

4) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE
5) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydddSkVz_a8
6) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development

README: When __developing__ client / server software you will build and run both the client and server on your **local machine**. When __testing__, you will test your work **locally** and on a __remote development server__. Prior to __release__, you and your colleagues will conduct user-acceptance, security, and stress testing with **remote servers and remote clients**.

### Part 4. Requests and Responses

You must understand the request / response cycle in client-server applications. You must understand how to:
1) Send a request to a server from a client
2) Proxy (forward) requests using a webserver program like Apache or Nginx, from the HTTP port to a process port or program executable
3) Action client requests to a server using a server script listening on a port 
4) Action client requests to a server using a server script to communicate to a hosted or remote database 
4) Action client requests to a server using a server script to communicate to a [3rd party API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Third_party_APIs), [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), or [Lambda compute](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66070926/difference-microservices-vs-lambda-vs-serverless-functions) [service](https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/function-as-a-service-faas/)
6) Action client requests to a server using a server script and output from a native application executable or shell script
7) Store data uploaded from the client to the server on the server's file system, in a database, or via a 3rd party service (like AWS S3)
8) Generate a proper response, with data payload and appropriate headers, to the client
9) Use the term API to refer to a library, function, script, or remote app that accepts requests (inputs), and sends responses (outputs): https://free-apis.github.io/#/ 
10) Use a CDN: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/

### Part 5. Tech Stacks

You should know what a "technology stack" means. A client-server app's tech stack refers to the set of commercial and free tools used to build, deploy, and host the app. Junior developers often [struggle](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.ahu2qlv13) to decide what tech stack tools to use to start out.  You'll find it's best to learn tools suited to complete _one critical part of the project at a time, in order from simple to complex_ (e.g., web client, server app, database, 3rd party API integrations, CI/CD pipelines / staging, QA / testing). You will avoid becoming paralyzed by choice when you understand that web application development can be as complex as you decide it has to be. You can make a web app with a few lines of PHP. You can also build out a complex automated deployment system with thousands of lines of code, using multiple languages and a diverse array of supporting software tools, that works like a factory to update and release your app. 

Tech stack advice: Learn a stack that has [deep roots and support from a big vendor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/quickstart-aspnet-core) as a safe bet, then engage with [newer](https://deno.com/deploy) [tools](https://svelte.dev) and [stacks](https://nextjs.org) from [open source](https://geekflare.com/self-hosted-s3/) communities, [academia](https://www.freebsd.org/), and [emerging](https://ipfs.io) tech providers, to broaden your skills.

Still struggling with stacks? Ask yourself, what is the motivation for this tool? What specific problem does it solve? Understand the problem first before you start learning solutions.

### E. DNS

You show know about A Records, MX Records, and other [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) records. You should understand how the internet associates human-readable names with machine-readable IP addresses. You should understand how DNS servers and [DNS applications](https://www.isc.org/bind/) work in concert with other key [server-based applications](https://www.networkstraining.com/different-types-of-servers/) to provide internet services.

### F. DevOps

By now, if you haven't already, you should learn the concept of [virtualization](https://www.ispsystem.com/news/brief-history-of-virtualization), and know the use cases for [different types of virtualization](https://www.liquidweb.com/blog/what-is-virtualization/), e.g., how [Virtual Private Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vps) (VPSs) [power the internet](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM), how software like [DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1wuBlgt3pY) tools, [IoT](https://blogs.infosys.com/engineering-services/5g-edge/iot-platform-engineering-with-device-virtualization.html) software, [operating systems](https://bellard.org/jslinux/), and even [game emulators](https://www.retrogames.cc/arcade-games/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes-980123-usa.html) utilize [virtualization layers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtualization-a-complete-guide) to function.

You should become proficient in DevOps. 

README: DevOps in practice means utilizing two main skills to automate tasks: 
1) Writing scripts to set up [virtual machines](https://youtu.be/wX75Z-4MEoM) (VMs) with the operating systems, databases and programs you want pre-installed and configured. These scripts can also set up [services](https://www.datacenters.com/news/kubernetes-vs-openstack) that help you [scale](https://youtu.be/J-xqz_ZM9Wg) your application, so it can manage many thousands, or even millions, of users.
2) Writing scripts to automate CICD (Continuous Integration / Deployment): This is automating the hosting of new versions of your app / game / tool via scripts that talk to your Github (or self-hosted) repo and your servers. 

README: You find the scripts and programs you want for DevOps "[orchestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing))" hosted online at different “hubs”, e.g.:

1) Ansible (set up programs on existing servers): https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?deprecated=false&keywords=penetration%20&order_by=-relevance&page=1
2) Vagrant (set up preconfigured servers / VMs): https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search?utf8=✓&sort=downloads&provider=&q=kali
3) Docker (set up “[containers](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/break-monolith-app-microservices-ecs-docker-ec2/?contd_bm3)“ a.k.a. "[microservices](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/)" - OSs and programs running inside their own little [VM-like processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-virtual-machine?rq=1)): https://hub.docker.com/search?q=kali&type=image ; https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/
4) Kubernetes (set up a "[cluster](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-a-kubernetes-cluster)" of containers grouped into "[pods](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/containers-vs-pods/)" across multiple "[nodes](https://medium.com/google-cloud/kubernetes-101-pods-nodes-containers-and-clusters-c1509e409e16)" - VPSs (VMs) or bare metal machines — so that the application components hosted in the containers (DBs, [MQs](https://youtu.be/nFxjaVmFj5E), clients, servers, monitoring tools, networking tools, etc.) scale and change automatically in response to network demand and application state): https://helm.sh

README: DevOps is also called [Infrastructure as Code](https://youtu.be/KxxRl6VEBxI) (IaC). Like most standardization processes, DevOps reduces the _fragility_ of systems by improving the reproducability and maintainablity of component parts. Client-server infrastructure scripts, for example, describe and deploy not only your app builds, but also infrastructure dependencies, including, but not limited to, hosts (VMs where your code runs), operating systems (programs that manage VM resources), web servers (programs to help forward requests to your software), load balancers (programs to help manage request-response traffic), message queues (programs to help manage sending messages like email password resets and in-app notifications to your clients), [caches](https://redis.io), [search indexes](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/), [databases](https://bitnami.com/stack/mariadb/helm), [block storage tools](https://min.io), [logging tools](https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/), [monitoring tools](https://prometheus.io), and more.

From the ground up: Vagrant and Ansible (or Terraform, or other competitor) let you write scripts / manifests / [serialization configs](https://faun.pub/an-introduction-to-yaml-for-devops-fff422d8805d) that can create, provision and update your VM servers, where your application runs in containers composed with Docker (or Containerd, or other competitor), which are coordinated and managed in a [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster) by Kubernetes (using a Kubernetes management program like [Keel](https://keel.sh)).

There are [many programs](https://digital.ai/periodic-table-of-devops-tools) on the market that help tie together and manage DevOps infrastructures with GUI systems and [YAML](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learn-yaml-devops-easy-way-sandip-das/)-inspired scripts. Learn what meets your needs. E.g., after you finish your first simple client-server-database app, write a `docker-compose` script that builds the app's infrastructure in steps as separate containers linked and hosted on your local machine. Then use [K3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/blob/master/README.md) to simulate locally how your app will be [orchestrated](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58638003/helm-charts-vs-ansible-playbook-vs-k8s-operator-in-system-installation#59317880) and managed on a "[cloud](https://pocketnow.com/no-such-thing-as-the-cloud)" host, and view your handiwork in a GUI-supported container management system like [Portainer](https://theselfhostingblog.com/posts/setting-up-a-kubernetes-cluster-using-raspberry-pis-k3s-and-portainer/) or [Rancher](https://vmguru.com/2021/04/how-to-install-rancher-on-k3s/).

You may be thinking this is quite a lot of ceremony for a web app! Do you really need to master advanced DevOps pipelining and orchestration tools to become an _amazing web developer_? 

No, you don't. 

How deep you want to go into DevOps depends on where you may work, or what you may want to do as an individual developer. You should learn the problems DevOps tools solve first, then decide if you need those solutions now, or if you're happier to acquire DevOps implementation details for your use cases as they become necessary to know. In the meantime, you can and should take [advantage](https://forge.laravel.com) of [services](https://www.meteor.com/cloud) that [solve](https://www.heroku.com) [common DevOps problems](https://vapor.laravel.com) for you, like [Netlify](https://netlify.app), [Laravel Vapor](https://youtu.be/iQHKY1vu_Ck), [Meteor Cloud](https://www.meteor.com/cloud), [Azure](https://portal.azure.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). 

What problems, after all, does a [multinode](https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-06/stanfords-artificial-neural-network-biggest-ever/) manager like Kubernetes (or [Titus](https://github.com/netflix)) actually solve? 

Well, [big ones, mostly](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/cern/). If you're building a web service that requires hundreds of nodes to support millions of customers, you may need to learn a tool like Kubernetes and a cloud management system like [OpenStack](https://youtu.be/PVPFT9k6ZUU). If you want to make an [AI tool](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oracle-partners-with-nvidia-to-solve-the-largest-ai-and-nlp-models) that must run on [thousands of nodes](https://datacenterfrontier.com/big-sur-closer-look-the-engine-powering-facebook-ai/) to crunch [petabytes](https://youtu.be/iUEecILAzR0) of data, and you want to use a large cloud vendor's machines with precision and thrift as demand scales, you will need to master DevOps software and scripting. 

[A media streaming service like Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix), e.g., must utilize DevOps tools, because of the amount of data and bandwidth the service provides: Millions of users watch 4K videos on demand using Netflix. The company can ill afford downtime. They will always need skilled DevOps engineers.

Scale determines needs. A simple web app will do just fine on a single node VPS host; but bigger problems require more complex solutions.

### G. DevSecOps

You should understand the purpose of automating security tools to test your software against [exploits and hacks](https://youtu.be/n31fogbmQTg).

README: For development security ops, e.g., you will use DevOps tools to spin up and test an application’s full server structure (all the VMs, services and containers) on your home PC (a machine with 32-64GB ram would be ideal for this, min. 16GB ram).

### I. Decentralization

Over two decades ago, in the late 90s, [distributed technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) and [torrent protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent) made large-file media [sharing](https://youtu.be/aP5F5kmWnsQ) inexpensive, fast and easy for users over [peer-to-peer](https://media.paloaltonetworks.com/documents/Controlling_P2P_Apps.pdf) [networks](https://medium.com/paratii/a-brief-history-of-p2p-content-distribution-in-10-major-steps-6d6733d25122). The rise and consolidation of [big-tech](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/faang-stocks.asp) services in the 00s brought back the heavyweight client-server paradigm. However, the emergence of inexpensive local storage, 5G tech and blockchain, could re-value [nimble products](https://medium.com/helium-blog/block-33-roaming-services-future-of-hotspot-apps-640k-strong-bcff93c8dc74) that leverage [mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking), [ad-hoc](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/ad-hoc-wireless-network), and [peer-to-peer networks](https://insight.openexo.com/the-future-is-peer-to-peer/). We may realize the "[democratization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization)" of communication and [trade](https://github.com/ethereum/) [foreshadowed](https://insight.openexo.com/the-future-is-peer-to-peer/) by technologies of the past. You should understand how the concept of [decentralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) [influences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAAXorA4pg8) [contemporary](https://mashable.com/article/what-is-an-nft-non-fungible-token) software development.

### K. Prototyping

You must understand the importance of prototyping.

Just as it's wise to plan, sketch, design, and finalize an architectural drawing before building a physical structure, so it is also wise to understake preliminary steps before coding a [software application](https://youtu.be/An7HC1LolDM). The [build phase](https://theproductmanager.com/topics/software-development-life-cycle/) of [software development]((https://orionadvisortech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screen-Shot-2019-11-04-at-1.13.10-PM.png)), as with construction, is time, money, and labor intensive, and consequential.  Whereas a sketch, detailed design, or mock up can be done and redone in minutes to hours, coding can take days and also requires debugging, versioning, testing, staging, deployment, QA, and maintenance after completion.

There are [many tools](https://www.lilachbullock.com/interactive-content-tools/) and [design systems](http://figma.com/) to help designers and developers create [interative mockups](https://webflow.com) prior to commiting the work to code, or avoid coding altogether. Developers are encouraged to learn a few of these to save time and money.

_Also stongly consider_ using a [no code / low code](https://youtu.be/jaRCENYBuYo) [platform](https://www.makerpad.co) or [form builder](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-online-form-builder) to rapidly [prototype](https://youtu.be/_1bOaNSy5XY) a working application before coding. This will help you discover and fix UI hiccups early on. 

You may, in fact, find a platform or builder that delivers an acceptable solution to the problem you were going to solve with a custom application, [without little to no coding at all](https://youtu.be/-_xKI3GJpMM), freeing you and your business to expend efforts on other valuable pursuits.

### L. Teamwork

You will be more employable at traditionally structured corporations and better prepared to contribute to OSS projects if you are comfortable working with other developers and other teams of developers. You should familiarize yourself with "agile" software development processes and learn to communicate via Github and Gitlab issues. Experiment on a group project with friends, or consider taking on a [Github](https://github.com/collections/choosing-projects) or [Gitlab issue](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/projects/) on an OSS project.
